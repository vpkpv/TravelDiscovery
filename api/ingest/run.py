"""CLI runner: ingest a fixed list of real videos and print the resulting
grounded venue records as JSON.

Usage (from the api/ directory, with GEMINI_API_KEY and
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY set in .env or the environment):

    python -m ingest.run

Requires real internet access (YouTube + Gemini + Places) — this cannot
run inside the Claude Code sandbox this pipeline was written in, which
blocks youtube.com by policy. Run it on a normal machine or in Cloud Run.
